## [1.4.2] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- **Advanced Dashboard UI** — complete rewrite of the monitoring dashboard
  - Dark/Light theme toggle with localStorage persistence
  - Tabbed navigation: Tunnels / Sessions / Inspector with live count badges

  - CSP nonce-based script security, no external dependencies

## [1.4.1] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed
- **Token auth not working** — `auth.NewManager` now accepts user-defined token (`-token` flag > `WIRERIFT_TOKEN` env > auto-random)
- **`--double-dash` flags** — both `-token` and `--token` now work
- Server banner quick start command address formatting

### Added
- `-token` flag on server CLI to set a persistent auth token
- Server banner shows full connection info + copy-paste quick start command

## [1.4.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- **Health check endpoint** (`/healthz`) for load balancer and orchestrator integration
- **X-Request-ID header** for distributed request tracing (auto-generated or preserved)
- **JSON config file support** (`wirerift.json`) alongside YAML, with auto-fallback
- **CSP nonce-based security** on dashboard
- E2E tests for healthz, X-Request-ID; 2500+ lines of new tests

### Security
- Replaced hardcoded HMAC key with per-instance `crypto/rand` secret for PIN cookies
- Added HTTP server timeouts (Slowloris DoS prevention)
- Fixed `sync.Map` race — atomic `LoadOrStore` of real tunnel
- Fixed `mux.Close()` not called on auth failure — goroutine leak
- CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy headers
- CSRF protection, `Secure` flag on PIN cookies, `MaxBytesReader` on POST

### Fixed
- Reconnect mux race — handlers receive mux as parameter instead of shared field
- Old mux goroutine leak on reconnect — explicit close before creating new
- `inspectResponseWriter` implements `http.Flusher` and `http.Hijacker`
- Request log slice memory leak — backing array released via copy
- Nil map panic in `handleTunnelClose` and `handleTunnelRequest`
- Silent `Close()` errors on TLS writes — `writeFileAtomic` checks close error
- ACME `io.ReadAll` bounded to 4MB; 6 ignored `json.Unmarshal` errors fixed
- DNS case-insensitive subdomain matching
- `time.After` leak replaced with `time.NewTimer` + `Stop()`

### Changed
- Server split: `server.go` → `pin.go`, `inspect.go`, `http_edge.go`
- ACME operations accept `context.Context` for cancellation
- Client uses shared `http.Client` with connection pooling
- `recover()` added to all production goroutines
- Graceful shutdown for HTTP/HTTPS edge servers

### Infrastructure
- Dockerfile: `scratch` → `alpine:3.20` with CA certs, non-root user, healthcheck
- docker-compose.yml: V2 format, TCP port range, healthcheck
- CI: `golangci-lint`, coverage artifact upload, 90% threshold
- Makefile: `test-race`, `fuzz`, `docker` targets
- `.golangci.yml`: `gosec`, `bodyclose`, `noctx`, `exportloopref` linters

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- **Let's Encrypt ACME** — automatic HTTPS via HTTP-01 challenge, zero external dependencies
- ACME account key management (ECDSA P-256, persisted to disk)
- JWS signed requests per RFC 8555
- HTTP-01 challenge solver with automatic token serving
- Certificate auto-renewal (12h check, 30-day pre-expiry renewal)
- Certificate bundle storage with metadata
- Fallback chain: disk → ACME → self-signed
- CLI flags: `-acme-email`, `-acme-staging`

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- **Basic Auth** for HTTP tunnels (`-auth user:pass`) with constant-time comparison
- **Custom Response Headers** (`-header "X-Robots:noindex,Cache-Control:no-store"`)
- **Traffic Inspector** — real-time request/response capture with dashboard UI
- **Request Replay** — replay any captured request from dashboard or API
- **File Server Mode** (`wirerift serve ./dist`) — serve static files through tunnel
- **Webhook Relay** — fan-out incoming requests to multiple local endpoints

## [1.1.1] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- Fuzz test suite: 6 fuzzers (~52M inputs, 0 crashes)
- Advanced test suite: security (16), stress (5), reconnect (5), soak (4) = 30 tests
- Benchmark suite: HTTP latency/throughput/concurrency, TCP throughput, tunnel creation
- CI: race detector, fuzz tests, advanced tests, coverage threshold enforcement

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- IP whitelist for HTTP tunnels (`-whitelist`) — IPv4/IPv6/CIDR per-tunnel
- PIN protection for HTTP tunnels (`-pin`) — browser form, header, or query param
- TCP tunnel whitelist enforcement
- Rate limiter eviction to prevent memory leak
- Server-side bytes_in/bytes_out traffic tracking

### Security
- Constant-time comparison in BasicAuth and PIN
- Modulo bias eliminated in random string generation
- TLS certificates written with 0600 permissions
- PIN cookie uses HMAC instead of raw value
- Stream ID 0 collision with ControlStreamID fixed

### Fixed
- Dashboard graceful shutdown timeout (was unbounded)
- Ring buffer growth capped at 16 MB
- `io.ReadAll` calls bounded (64 MB responses, 32 MB request bodies)
- Port allocation race condition fixed with modulo wrap-around
- Unique request IDs via `crypto/rand`

### Removed
- ~3,100 lines of dead code (unused packages, types, error sentinels, utilities)
