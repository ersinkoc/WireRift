- Dashboard CSS rendering (double-percent escape in Go raw string)

### Changed
- README updated with v1.4.x features: token auth, JSON config, dashboard, healthz, X-Request-ID
- Full codebase audit: 0 bugs found, all 15 packages pass, 97-100% coverage

## [1.4.2] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- **Advanced Dashboard UI** — complete rewrite of the monitoring dashboard
  - Dark/Light theme toggle with localStorage persistence
  - Tabbed navigation: Tunnels / Sessions / Inspector with live count badges

  - Live uptime counter ticking every second
  - Keyboard shortcuts: R=refresh, T=tunnels, S=sessions, I=inspector
  - Tunnel URL copy-to-clipboard with visual feedback
  - Session expandable detail rows
  - Traffic Inspector with request/response headers side-by-side
  - JSON syntax highlighting (keys=cyan, strings=green, numbers=amber, bools=purple)

## [1.4.1] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed
- **Token auth not working** — `auth.NewManager` now accepts user-defined token (`-token` flag > `WIRERIFT_TOKEN` env > auto-random)
- **`--double-dash` flags** — both `-token` and `--token` now work (Go's `flag` package only supports single dash)
- Server banner quick start command address formatting

### Added
- `-token` flag on server CLI to set a persistent auth token
- Server banner shows full connection info (control, HTTP, dashboard, domain) + copy-paste quick start command

## [1.4.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- **Health check endpoint** (`/healthz`) for load balancer and orchestrator integration
- **X-Request-ID header** for distributed request tracing (auto-generated or preserved from client)
- **JSON config file support** (`wirerift.json`) alongside YAML, with auto-fallback
- **CSP nonce-based security** on dashboard — each request gets a unique script nonce
- **Healthz benchmark** in benchmark suite
- **E2E tests** for healthz, X-Request-ID generation, X-Request-ID preservation
- **2500+ lines of new tests** across all packages
- Token banner display on server startup with copy-friendly format and export command

### Security
- **CRITICAL**: Replaced hardcoded HMAC key with per-instance `crypto/rand` secret for PIN cookies
- **CRITICAL**: Added `ReadHeaderTimeout`, `ReadTimeout`, `WriteTimeout`, `IdleTimeout` to all HTTP servers (Slowloris DoS prevention)
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed `sync.Map` race — empty `&Tunnel{}` placeholder replaced with atomic `LoadOrStore` of real tunnel
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed `mux.Close()` not called on auth failure — goroutine leak on failed connections
- Added `Content-Security-Policy` with per-request nonce to dashboard
- Added `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy` headers
- CSRF protection: session cookies restricted to GET-only requests on dashboard
- `Secure` flag on PIN cookies when served over HTTPS
- `MaxBytesReader` (1MB) on dashboard POST endpoints
- Generic `"Unauthorized"` error messages (no internal detail leakage)
- `gosec`, `bodyclose`, `noctx` linters added to CI

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Reconnect mux race — `handleStreams` and `heartbeatLoop` now receive mux as parameter instead of reading shared `c.mux` field
- **CRITICAL**: Old mux goroutine leak on reconnect — old mux and connection are explicitly closed before creating new ones
- **HIGH**: `inspectResponseWriter` now implements `http.Flusher` and `http.Hijacker` — streaming and WebSocket tunnels work with `inspect=true`
- **HIGH**: Request log slice memory leak — backing array properly released via copy
- **HIGH**: Nil map panic in `handleTunnelClose` and `handleTunnelRequest` — nil checks added
- **HIGH**: Silent `Close()` errors on TLS certificate writes — `writeFileAtomic` helper checks close error
- **HIGH**: ACME `io.ReadAll` without size limit — bounded to 4MB
- **HIGH**: 6 ignored `json.Unmarshal` errors in ACME flow — all checked
- DNS case-insensitive subdomain matching (`extractSubdomain` lowercases input)
- `X-Forwarded-For` now strips port and chains with existing header
- `time.After` leak in reconnect loop replaced with `time.NewTimer` + `Stop()`
- `json.Encode` errors explicitly handled in dashboard responses
- ACME metadata write error now logged (was silently ignored)
- Non-deterministic domain verification codes — now stored at creation time

### Changed
- **Server architecture**: `server.go` (1575→1025 lines) split into `pin.go`, `inspect.go`, `http_edge.go`
- `handleTunnelRequest` (135 lines) refactored into `createHTTPTunnel`, `createTCPTunnel`, `sendTunnelError`
- `fmt.Sprintf("tcp:%d")` replaced with `strconv.Itoa` + string concatenation
- ACME operations accept `context.Context` for cancellation support
- `StartAutoRenewal` uses cancellable context derived from done channel
- `checkAndRenew` extracted as testable function from renewal loop
- `GetCertificate` uses `hello.Context()` for ACME request cancellation
- Client uses shared `http.Client` with connection pooling instead of per-request client
- `doServe` file server uses `http.Server.Shutdown` for graceful cleanup
- `recover()` added to all production goroutines (TCP proxy, webhook relay, ACME renewal, stream handler, dashboard)
- Graceful shutdown for HTTP/HTTPS edge servers via `http.Server.Shutdown`
- Removed dead code: no-op `init()`, misleading interface assertion, custom `min()` (Go 1.23 builtin)

### Infrastructure
- **Dockerfile**: `scratch` → `alpine:3.20` with CA certificates, non-root user, healthcheck
- **docker-compose.yml**: V2 format, TCP port range, healthcheck, command parameters
- **CI**: Added `golangci-lint` step, coverage artifact upload, threshold adjusted to 90%
- **Makefile**: Added `test-race`, `fuzz`, `docker`, improved `lint` targets
- **.golangci.yml**: Added `gosec`, `bodyclose`, `noctx`, `exportloopref` linters

### Added
- IP whitelist for HTTP tunnels (`-whitelist 1.2.3.4,10.0.0.0/8`) - restrict tunnel access by IP/CIDR

- Fix: `IsValidSubdomain` rejects trailing hyphens per RFC 1123

### Fixed
